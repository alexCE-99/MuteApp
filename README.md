The default values are shown in the textbox. They are:

- ' ] ' for unmute
- 'escape' for exiting the script

To change these values, type the key you would like to use into the field and click the associated button. For button combinations separate each key with a '+'.

For example:

- Shift + M
- Ctrl + M
- Shift + F1

Note that in the current version these settings will reset upon a restart.
